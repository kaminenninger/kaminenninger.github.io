      <h1>Did you ever think I'd make a website? Probably not...</h1>
        <h2>Reasons why you probably thought that</h2>
          <h3>I didn't major in computer science</h3>
            <p>That's true. I majored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_science" target="_blank">food science</a>, a regret I have to this day.</p>
          <h3>I'm not passionate about technology</h3>
            <p>While I'm not necessarily passionate about technology, I'm not <em>bad</em> with it. I <em>am</em> passionate about learning and I'm good at taking initiative.</p>
          <h3>I'm lazy</h3>
            <p>I think I'm proving that wrong right now.</p>
          <h3>Because I began with Python</h3>
            <p>I was over 50% of the way through the Python course on Codecademy before I realized it was better to start with <code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code>. Oh well. I cut my losses and honestly, it made me comfortable with the field. I'm sure I'll come back to it again.</p>
